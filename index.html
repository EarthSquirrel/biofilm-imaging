<h1>CSCI 592: Using Imaging to Solve Biofilm Research Questions (SP22)</h1>

<h2>About</h2>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>In this course, I will first gain a basic knowledge of biofilms and biofilm
imaging by reading papers. Next, I will work with multiple labs in the CBE to
learn about the problems they are trying to solve and how they use imaging to do
so. Then I will look into image file types and specifics of different analyses
used.</p>

<h3>Objectives</h3>
<ul>
<li>Be able to describe what a biofilm is and why they are important to understand/study </li>
<li>Be able to describe different problems biofilm researchers are trying to solve </li>
<li>Be able to describe how imaging techniques are being used to solve said problems </li>
<li>Be able to list and have a basic understanding of other analysis techniques that are used alongside imaging and how they may enhance what is learned from image data </li>
<li>Understand how different analysis/image modifications affect the conclusions that can be drawn from images </li>
</ul>
