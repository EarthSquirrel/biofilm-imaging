<h1>CSCI 592: Using Imaging to Solve Biofilm Research Questions (SP22)</h1>

<h2>About</h2>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>In this course, I will first gain a basic knowledge of biofilms and biofilm
imaging by reading papers. Next, I will work with multiple labs in the CBE to
learn about the problems they are trying to solve and how they use imaging to do
so. Then I will look into image file types and specifics of different analyses
used.</p>

<h3>Old Objectives</h3>
<ul>
<li>Be able to describe what a biofilm is and why they are important to understand/study </li>
<li>Be able to describe different problems biofilm researchers are trying to solve </li>
<li>Be able to describe how imaging techniques are being used to solve said problems </li>
<li>Be able to list and have a basic understanding of other analysis techniques that are used alongside imaging and how they may enhance what is learned from image data </li>
<li>Understand how different analysis/image modifications affect the conclusions that can be drawn from images </li>
</ul>

<h3>Objectives</h3>
<ul>
<li> Compare/contrast different image analysis techniques and in which cases
they make sense.
  <ul>
  <li>Why might these techniques be used in cases where they aren't ideal?</li>
  <li>How do file types limit analysis that can be run?</li>
  </ul>
<li> Create a well-formed general or central problem statement and options for
solutions</li>
<li>Create a mind map of relationships between different biofilm problems and
analysis techniques (primarily image based but include others and how they
supplement image analysis)</li>
</ul>

<!--
* Compare/contrast different image analysis techniques and if which cases they
make sense
* Create a well-formed general or central problem statement and options for
solutions
* Create a mind map of relationships between different biofilm problems and
analysis techniques (primarily image based but include others and how they
supplement image analysis)
* If ___ then you can learn ___, for image acquisition methods and image file
types
  * What are the different image file types?
  * What types of microscopes are there and what can you learn from their
  images?
  * For which problems do which methods make sense to use? Which don't and why?
* If you use analysis A on image format B (if it's possible), then you can
draw which conclusions
