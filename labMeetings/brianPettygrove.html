<p>The immune system is able to kill foreign bacteria within the human body. 
However, the immune system has a more difficult time when a foreign body, such 
as a medical implant is present [2]. 
Medical implants consist of things such as prosthetic joints, breast implants, 
catheters, and orthopedic screws, which can cause infections [2]. 
Bacteria may originate from within body or from skin while being implanted. 
Brian is looking to see how neutrophils interact with bacteria to clear them. 
He is curious if bacteria have an advantage by simply being attached to a 
surface. </p>

<p>Neutrophil efficiency at eliminating biofilm formation is likely limited by 
their initial concentration and ability to detect the bacteria and not bacterial
virulence (*1). 
When the bacteria were not given a chance to grow into aggregates, neutrophils 
were significantly more effective at killing single-cell bacteria, therefore 
being attached to the surface is not an initial benefit [1]. 
The longer the bacteria is able to grow before neutrophils begin attacking, the 
harder it is to kill the bacteria and after a three hour head start of bacterial
growth, they were unable to kill all bacteria [2]. 
Being attached to a surface did not appear to benefit the bacteria while the 
aggregates were still small because the decrease in bacterial biomass was 
similar to planktonic bacteria with similar neutrophil/bacterium 
ratios [2] (*2).</p>
